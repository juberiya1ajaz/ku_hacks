- Hedera: For deploying a smart contract
- ML: Tensorflow.Js
- Training the Model: Google Teachable Machine
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 
- For internationalization: i18n

## 🔐 Best Project Built on Solana

We are using Solana for building a secure decentralized and secure payment platform. It is a decentralized, distributed, and open-source blockchain that is designed to be a secure, scalable, and reliable platform for smart contracts.

<!-- ## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to deploy **smart contracts** for our app and make the **decentralized chatroom**. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications -->

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project in a deadline.
- Working with Hedera’s testnet was a challenge because it was a new technology but we were albe to implement it.
- Implementing the Solana blockchain was a challenge because we had to use the Solana SDK to interact with the blockchain.
