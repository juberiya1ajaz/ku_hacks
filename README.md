# ScanCure

## üíª What it does
Most of the time we ran into the problem of unavailability of doctors. The matter is more concerning when we do not know what is happening to us. ScanCure is a web application where users can take a Parkinson's test to check if they have Parkinson's or not. There are many other tests available as well where you can easily know whether your symptoms are concerning or not. These tests include Gastrointestinal Stomach Tumor, Brain Tumor, and Skin Cancer. You can also search for nearby hospitals as well. We have provided a secure and robust payment method based on blockchain. We have a special portal to talk with doctors, you just have to make the payment with help of Solana and get the consultation in one tap. There is also a chatroom for users based on hedera . The application will help people in need of medical care and supervision to understand the implications of different diseases in a very intuitive way. It will also help people to find the right medical care/supervision for themselves.

<!-- ## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- Frontend: React Js
- Secure decentralized network: Solana
- Hedera: For deploying a smart contract
- ML: Tensorflow.Js
- Training the Model: Google Teachable Machine
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 
- For internationalization: i18n

## üîê Best Project Built on Solana

We are using Solana for building a secure decentralized and secure payment platform. It is a decentralized, distributed, and open-source blockchain that is designed to be a secure, scalable, and reliable platform for smart contracts.

<!-- ## üîê Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera‚Äôs testnet** to deploy **smart contracts** for our app and make the **decentralized chatroom**. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications -->

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project in a deadline.
- Working with Hedera‚Äôs testnet was a challenge because it was a new technology but we were albe to implement it.
- Implementing the Solana blockchain was a challenge because we had to use the Solana SDK to interact with the blockchain.
